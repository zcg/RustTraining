A practical guide to using Rust's type system to make entire classes of bugs **impossible to compile**. While the companion [Rust Patterns](../../rust-patterns-book/src/SUMMARY.md) book covers the mechanics (traits, associated types, type-state), this guide shows how to **apply** those mechanics to real-world domains — hardware diagnostics, cryptography, protocol validation, and embedded systems.

Every pattern here follows one principle: **push invariants from runtime checks into the type system so the compiler enforces them.**

## The Correct-by-Construction Spectrum

```text
← Less Safe                                                    More Safe →

Runtime checks      Unit tests        Property tests      Correct by Construction
─────────────       ──────────        ──────────────      ──────────────────────

if temp > 100 {     #[test]           proptest! {         struct Celsius(f64);
  panic!("too       fn test_temp() {    |t in 0..200| {   // Can't confuse with Rpm
  hot");              assert!(          assert!(...)       // at the type level
}                     check(42));     }
                    }                 }
                                                          Invalid program?
Invalid program?    Invalid program?  Invalid program?    Won't compile.
Crashes in prod.    Fails in CI.      Fails in CI         Never exists.
                                      (probabilistic).
```

This guide operates at the rightmost position — where bugs don't exist because the type system **cannot express them**.
