Code coverage measures which lines, branches, or functions your tests actually
execute. It doesn't prove correctness (a covered line can still have bugs), but
it reliably reveals **blind spots** — code paths that no test exercises at all.

With 1,006 tests across many crates, the project has substantial test investment.
Coverage analysis answers: "Is that investment reaching the code that matters?"

### Source-Based Coverage with `llvm-cov`

Rust uses LLVM, which provides source-based coverage instrumentation — the most
accurate coverage method available. The recommended tool is
[`cargo-llvm-cov`](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov):

```bash
# Install
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov

# Or via rustup component (for the raw llvm tools)
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
```

**Basic usage:**

```bash
# Run tests and show per-file coverage summary
cargo llvm-cov

# Generate HTML report (browsable, line-by-line highlighting)
cargo llvm-cov --html
# Output: target/llvm-cov/html/index.html

# Generate LCOV format (for CI integrations)
cargo llvm-cov --lcov --output-path lcov.info

# Workspace-wide coverage (all crates)
cargo llvm-cov --workspace

# Include only specific packages
cargo llvm-cov --package accel_diag --package topology_lib

# Coverage including doc tests
cargo llvm-cov --doctests
```

**Reading the HTML report:**

```text
target/llvm-cov/html/index.html
├── Filename          │ Function │ Line   │ Branch │ Region
├─ accel_diag/src/lib.rs │  78.5%  │ 82.3% │ 61.2% │  74.1%
├─ sel_mgr/src/parse.rs│  95.2%  │ 96.8% │ 88.0% │  93.5%
├─ topology_lib/src/.. │  91.0%  │ 93.4% │ 79.5% │  89.2%
└─ ...

Green = covered    Red = not covered    Yellow = partially covered (branch)
```

**Coverage types explained:**

| Type | What It Measures | Significance |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| **Line coverage** | Which source lines were executed | Basic "was this code reached?" |
| **Branch coverage** | Which `if`/`match` arms were taken | Catches untested conditions |
| **Function coverage** | Which functions were called | Finds dead code |
| **Region coverage** | Which code regions (sub-expressions) were hit | Most granular |

### cargo-tarpaulin — The Quick Path

[`cargo-tarpaulin`](https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin) is a Linux-specific
coverage tool that's simpler to set up (no LLVM components needed):

```bash
# Install
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin

# Basic coverage report
cargo tarpaulin

# HTML output
cargo tarpaulin --out Html

# With specific options
cargo tarpaulin \
    --workspace \
    --timeout 120 \
    --out Xml Html \
    --output-dir coverage/ \
    --exclude-files "*/tests/*" "*/benches/*" \
    --ignore-panics

# Skip certain crates
cargo tarpaulin --workspace --exclude diag_tool  # exclude the binary crate
```

**tarpaulin vs llvm-cov comparison:**

| Feature | cargo-llvm-cov | cargo-tarpaulin |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Accuracy | Source-based (most accurate) | Ptrace-based (occasional overcounting) |
| Platform | Any (llvm-based) | Linux only |
| Branch coverage | Yes | Limited |
| Doc tests | Yes | No |
| Setup | Needs `llvm-tools-preview` | Self-contained |
| Speed | Faster (compile-time instrumentation) | Slower (ptrace overhead) |
| Stability | Very stable | Occasional false positives |

**Recommendation**: Use `cargo-llvm-cov` for accuracy. Use `cargo-tarpaulin` when
you need a quick check without installing LLVM tools.

### grcov — Mozilla's Coverage Tool

[`grcov`](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov) is Mozilla's coverage aggregator.
It consumes raw LLVM profiling data and produces reports in multiple formats:

```bash
# Install
cargo install grcov

# Step 1: Build with coverage instrumentation
export RUSTFLAGS="-Cinstrument-coverage"
export LLVM_PROFILE_FILE="target/coverage/%p-%m.profraw"
cargo build --tests

# Step 2: Run tests (generates .profraw files)
cargo test

# Step 3: Aggregate with grcov
grcov target/coverage/ \
    --binary-path target/debug/ \
    --source-dir . \
    --output-types html,lcov \
    --output-path target/coverage/report \
    --branch \
    --ignore-not-existing \
    --ignore "*/tests/*" \
    --ignore "*/.cargo/*"

# Step 4: View report
open target/coverage/report/html/index.html
```

**When to use grcov**: It's most useful when you need to **merge coverage from
multiple test runs** (e.g., unit tests + integration tests + fuzz tests) into a
single report.

### Coverage in CI: Codecov and Coveralls

Upload coverage data to a tracking service for historical trends and PR annotations:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/coverage.yml
name: Code Coverage

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
        with:
          components: llvm-tools-preview

      - name: Install cargo-llvm-cov
        uses: taiki-e/install-action@cargo-llvm-cov

      - name: Generate coverage
        run: cargo llvm-cov --workspace --lcov --output-path lcov.info

      - name: Upload to Codecov
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
        with:
          files: lcov.info
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
          fail_ci_if_error: true

      # Optional: enforce minimum coverage
      - name: Check coverage threshold
        run: |
          cargo llvm-cov --workspace --fail-under-lines 80
          # Fails the build if line coverage drops below 80%
```

**Coverage gates** — enforce minimums per crate by reading the JSON output:

```bash
# Get per-crate coverage as JSON
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --json | jq '.data[0].totals.lines.percent'

# Fail if below threshold
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --fail-under-lines 80
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --fail-under-functions 70
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --fail-under-regions 60
```

### Coverage-Guided Testing Strategy

Coverage numbers alone are meaningless without a strategy. Here's how to use
coverage data effectively:

**Step 1: Triage by risk**

```text
High coverage, high risk     → ✅ Good — maintain it
High coverage, low risk      → 🔄 Possibly over-tested — skip if slow
Low coverage, high risk      → 🔴 Write tests NOW — this is where bugs hide
Low coverage, low risk       → 🟡 Track but don't panic
```

**Step 2: Focus on branch coverage, not line coverage**

```rust
// 100% line coverage, 50% branch coverage — still risky!
pub fn classify_temperature(temp_c: i32) -> ThermalState {
    if temp_c > 105 {       // ← tested with temp=110 → Critical
        ThermalState::Critical
    } else if temp_c > 85 { // ← tested with temp=90 → Warning
        ThermalState::Warning
    } else if temp_c < -10 { // ← NEVER TESTED → sensor error case missed
        ThermalState::SensorError
    } else {
        ThermalState::Normal  // ← tested with temp=25 → Normal
    }
}
```

**Step 3: Exclude noise**

```bash
# Exclude test code from coverage (it's always "covered")
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --ignore-filename-regex 'tests?\.rs$|benches/'

# Exclude generated code
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --ignore-filename-regex 'target/'
```

In code, mark untestable sections:

```rust
// Coverage tools recognize this pattern
#[cfg(not(tarpaulin_include))]  // tarpaulin
fn unreachable_hardware_path() {
    // This path requires actual GPU hardware to trigger
}

// For llvm-cov, use a more targeted approach:
// Simply accept that some paths need integration/hardware tests,
// not unit tests. Track them in a coverage exceptions list.
```

### Complementary Testing Tools

**`proptest` — Property-Based Testing** finds edge cases that hand-written tests miss:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
proptest = "1"
```

```rust
use proptest::prelude::*;

proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn parse_never_panics(input in "\\PC*") {
        // proptest generates thousands of random strings
        // If parse_gpu_csv panics on any input, the test fails
        // and proptest minimizes the failing case for you.
        let _ = parse_gpu_csv(&input);
    }

    #[test]
    fn temperature_roundtrip(raw in 0u16..4096) {
        let temp = Temperature::from_raw(raw);
        let md = temp.millidegrees_c();
        // Property: millidegrees should always be derivable from raw
        assert_eq!(md, (raw as i32) * 625 / 10);
    }
}
```

**`insta` — Snapshot Testing** for large structured outputs (JSON, text reports):

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
insta = { version = "1", features = ["json"] }
```

```rust
#[test]
fn test_der_report_format() {
    let report = generate_der_report(&test_results);
    // First run: creates a snapshot file. Subsequent runs: compares against it.
    // Run `cargo insta review` to accept changes interactively.
    insta::assert_json_snapshot!(report);
}
```

> **When to add proptest/insta**: If your unit tests are all "happy path" examples,
> proptest will find the edge cases you missed. If you're testing large output
> formats (JSON reports, DER records), insta snapshots are faster to write and
> maintain than hand-written assertions.

### Application: 1,000+ Tests Coverage Map

The project has 1,000+ tests but no coverage tracking. Adding it
reveals the testing investment distribution. Uncovered paths are prime candidates
for [Miri and sanitizer](ch05-miri-valgrind-and-sanitizers-verifying-u.md) verification:

**Recommended coverage configuration:**

```bash
# Quick workspace coverage (proposed CI command)
cargo llvm-cov --workspace \
    --ignore-filename-regex 'tests?\.rs$' \
    --fail-under-lines 75 \
    --html

# Per-crate coverage for targeted improvement
for crate in accel_diag event_log topology_lib network_diag compute_diag fan_diag; do
    echo "=== $crate ==="
    cargo llvm-cov --package "$crate" --json 2>/dev/null | \
        jq -r '.data[0].totals | "Lines: \(.lines.percent | round)%  Branches: \(.branches.percent | round)%"'
done
```

**Expected high-coverage crates** (based on test density):
- `topology_lib` — 922-line golden-file test suite
- `event_log` — registry with `create_test_record()` helpers
- `cable_diag` — `make_test_event()` / `make_test_context()` patterns

**Expected coverage gaps** (based on code inspection):
- Error handling arms in IPMI communication paths
- GPU hardware-specific branches (require actual GPU)
- `dmesg` parsing edge cases (platform-dependent output)

> **The 80/20 rule of coverage**: Getting from 0% to 80% coverage is straightforward.
> Getting from 80% to 95% requires increasingly contrived test scenarios. Getting
> from 95% to 100% requires `#[cfg(not(...))]` exclusions and is rarely worth the
> effort. Target **80% line coverage and 70% branch coverage** as a practical floor.

### Troubleshooting Coverage

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `llvm-cov` shows 0% for all files | Instrumentation not applied | Ensure you run `cargo llvm-cov`, not `cargo test` + `llvm-cov` separately |
| Coverage counts `unreachable!()` as uncovered | Those branches exist in compiled code | Use `#[cfg(not(tarpaulin_include))]` or add to exclusion regex |
| Test binary crashes under coverage | Instrumentation + sanitizer conflict | Don't combine `cargo llvm-cov` with `-Zsanitizer=address`; run them separately |
| Coverage differs between `llvm-cov` and `tarpaulin` | Different instrumentation techniques | Use `llvm-cov` as source of truth (compiler-native); file issues for large discrepancies |
| `error: profraw file is malformed` | Test binary crashed mid-execution | Fix the test failure first; profraw files are corrupt when the process exits abnormally |
| Branch coverage seems impossibly low | Optimizer creates branches for match arms, unwrap, etc. | Focus on *line* coverage for practical thresholds; branch coverage is inherently lower |

### Try It Yourself

1. **Measure coverage on your project**: Run `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --html`
   and open the report. Find the three files with the lowest coverage. Are they
   untested, or inherently hard to test (hardware-dependent code)?

2. **Set a coverage gate**: Add `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --fail-under-lines 60`
   to your CI. Intentionally comment out a test and verify CI fails. Then raise
   the threshold to your project's actual coverage level minus 2%.

3. **Branch vs. line coverage**: Write a function with a 3-arm `match` and
   test only 2 arms. Compare line coverage (may show 66%) vs. branch coverage
   (may show 50%). Which metric is more useful for your project?

### 🏋️ Exercises

#### 🟢 Exercise 1: First Coverage Report

Install `cargo-llvm-cov`, run it on any Rust project, and open the HTML report. Find the three files with the lowest line coverage.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```bash
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --html --open
# The report sorts files by coverage — lowest at the bottom
# Look for files under 50% — those are your blind spots
```
</details>

#### 🟡 Exercise 2: CI Coverage Gate

Add a coverage gate to a GitHub Actions workflow that fails if line coverage drops below 60%. Verify it works by commenting out a test.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```yaml
# .github/workflows/coverage.yml
name: Coverage
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
        with:
          components: llvm-tools-preview
      - run: cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
      - run: cargo llvm-cov --workspace --fail-under-lines 60
```

Comment out a test, push, and watch the workflow fail.
</details>

### Key Takeaways

- `cargo-llvm-cov` is the most accurate coverage tool for Rust — it uses the compiler's own instrumentation
- Coverage doesn't prove correctness, but **zero coverage proves zero testing** — use it to find blind spots
- Set a coverage gate in CI (e.g., `--fail-under-lines 80`) to prevent regressions
- Don't chase 100% coverage — focus on high-risk code paths (error handling, unsafe, parsing)
- Never combine coverage instrumentation with sanitizers in the same run
